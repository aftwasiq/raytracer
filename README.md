# Raytracer v1.1
A simple raytracing implemention using C++. Currently, it is able to render a sphere and apply properties such as diffusion and anti-aliasing.

I originally made this project a couple months ago following a raytracing tutorial, while trying to improve my C++ capabilities. The first iteration was messy, so I decided to go ahead and do it again 5 months afterwards without the tutorial and just my original project, and this is the result. I used my original project files as reference aswell as my own memory, which is why the project in incomplete (as compared to the original), and does not include many properties like materials, colors, refraction. The original project was created using the tutorial by Peter Shirleys book, Raytracing in a weekend.
